# Hack the Nest 2023

## Overview

This September, Hack the Nest invites 300 young developers on the east
coast to a 36-hour hackathon in the heart of Maryland. Our team has
been working tirelessly alongside our administration to pack our
schedule to the brim with educational workshops, exciting side events,
and exotic prizes. Whether it’s ping-pong without paddles or
late-night debugging with cookies, our ultimate goal is to host an
unforgettable experience for an audience of hackers normally barred
from hackathons. This website serves as both an informational asset to potential participants and sponsors, as well as an event management tool for organizers.
